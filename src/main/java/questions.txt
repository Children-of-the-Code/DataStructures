why do we use length for arrays and size() for all data structions?
length is a field of arrays, it's a regular variable (int)
but the length of arraylists/linkelists/etc are private
size() is a method that returns that length
why size over length? not clear..
my guess is that the physical length of data structures sometimes needs to be abstracted away
(because the physical space used by an arraylist is not necessarily the amount of data stored
because an arraylist doubles in size when it fills up)

for p1:
use a java data structure (most likely a combination of arraylist and hashset to solve your problems
in a fake "repository" class)
using the repository class will mirror how you have to interact with a database, which
will first read from the DB over the internet and then load the persisted objects into
a data structure
